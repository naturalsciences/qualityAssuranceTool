== Description

The goal of this project is to perform basic quality checks on data. The
project adds quality flags to the database (if configured). The project
should/will be structured that adding a new algorithm is as simple as
changing a config file (yaml).

== Installation

As it is a python project, no _real_ installation is needed, but a
runtime python environment needs to be created where the needed packages
are available. The needed packages are listed in the file
`requirements.txt`.

=== Linux

When working on a linux kernel, the setup and the running of the project
can be done through `make`.

=== Windows

No install script if foreseen for windows.

== TODO

* [ ] Patch on test db
* [ ] REF iterrows() -> function on columns
* [ ] filter on date/time/â€¦
* [ ] Z needed in ISO time
* [ ] put flag to BAD
* [ ] 160, 170 first sensors to focus on
** waterflow is first one to check
* [ ] geolocation -> when requesting expand feature of interest -> goes
from 1 to 13 seconds!!
** feature of interest -> is the point close to the one before
** one location is shared by all datastreams, can be done for all

== Questions

* observedArea
** are the coordinates based on the coordinates of the observations? or
preset? If preset, could be checked if in box
** what coordinate reference system is used?
** ?
